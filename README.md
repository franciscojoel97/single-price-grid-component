## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned the handling of the CSS Grid component and the use of the grid-template-areas property. Use semantic HTML 5 tags, the final layout adjusts based on the screen size of the display device.
Here are some CSS code snippets applied in the solution:

```css
.main-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "section1 section1"
    "section2 section3";
}

.section1 {
  grid-area: section1;
}
```
